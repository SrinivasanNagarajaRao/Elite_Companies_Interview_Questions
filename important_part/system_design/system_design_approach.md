# Clarification

- You are given a purposefully vague question. Part of the assessment of the 
interviewer is to see how well you handle vague requirements.

. . .

- Similar to a more standard technical interview question, you should clarify
 ambiguous points with your interviewer. 
 
. . .

- This gives them a good picture as to how you will deal with these scenarios
 on the job.

# Asking Good Questions

- The purpose of asking clarifying questions is to dispel the ambiguity and
  to uncover an actionable piece of the puzzle. 

. . .

- A good question will give direction and determine the needs of the customer.

. . .

- Implementing something completely different than what the customer wants
 certainly has bad implications for the company. Try to whittle away at
 the problem statement until the scope, motivation, and direction is clear.

. . .

- It is better to ask a question that seems trivial than to assume the intent
 and as a result implement the wrong solution for the problem statement.

# Understanding the Problem 

- Ensure that prior to proposing any solution or code that you understand
 the problem statement and can reiterate it back to the interviewer.

. . .

- Furthermore, make sure that you have a solid grasp on the constraints,
 bottlenecks, scope, goals, etc. of the problem you are attempting to solve.

. . .

- Understanding all of these components will make solving the problem itself
 much less daunting.

# Focusing Scope 

- Depending on your background if asked to design a large software service,
 like Facebook for instance, your response will most likely be based on
 your area of expertise.

. . .

- For instance, if you are a front-end developer, you may spend more time
 on designing the user interface and if you are a back-end developer, you
 may decide to speak more on that side. The focus also of course depends
 on the role to which you are applying for.

. . .

- Since system design interviews are generally given to candidates who have
 had previous experience, you can showcase your specialty and make a strong
 case for what your skills specifically bring to the table.

# Tackling the Problem

- Once you and the interviewer are on the same page as to what the goals,
 scope, etc. of the project is, it's time to drill down and be more specific
 with how you will go about solving the problems at hand.

. . .

- Typically, abstracting certain pieces of functionality into some type
 of high-level API is a way in which to organize the major components of
 the system.

# Tackling the Problem

- Being able to intelligently talk about the trade-offs of different database
 technology is a major plus. For instance, knowing the difference between a
 SQL and NoSQL database and why you might want to use either one for the task
 at hand helps guide your design process.

. . .

- The technologies of SQL and NoSQL in their entirety can be daunting, but for
 the purpose of this interview, unless you're interviewing for a database 
 position, it will typically be fine to just have a high-level understanding
 of the technology, trade-offs, etc.
